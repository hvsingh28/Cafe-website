# The Silk Cup Caf√© Web App

Welcome to the new and improved web experience for **The Silk Cup Caf√©**!  
This project was originally built using traditional web technologies, but has now been **rebuilt from scratch using React** for a modern, interactive, and maintainable codebase.

## ‚ú® Why This Project Stands Out

- **Modern React Stack:**  
  Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS for a fast, responsive, and scalable frontend.

- **AI-Enhanced Development:**  
  During development, I leveraged **Cursor** and AI tools at key steps‚Äîespecially for implementing complex animations and UI effects. This allowed for rapid prototyping and creative experimentation, demonstrating my ability to effectively use AI as a productivity and innovation booster (not as a replacement for core coding skills).

- **Complex Animations:**  
  Features advanced UI animations (such as glitch effects, scroll reveals, and 3D-tilted cards) that enhance user engagement and showcase proficiency in both animation libraries and AI-assisted design.

## üåü Features

- **Immersive Landing Page:**  
  Hero section with animated, blurred, and glitch text overlays, plus a visually rich background.

- **Dynamic Menu:**  
  Browse a British-inspired menu with categories for breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, beverages, and desserts.

- **Reservation System:**  
  Book a table with a user-friendly form. Reservations are stored locally for demo purposes.

- **Customer Reviews:**  
  Read and submit reviews, with a live-updating, animated review carousel.

- **Multilingual Support:**  
  Switch between English and Hindi instantly.

- **Interactive Animations:**  
  - **GlitchText**: Animated glitch effect for headings.
  - **ScrollReveal**: Text and elements animate into view as you scroll.
  - **TiltedCard**: 3D-tilt effect on cards and buttons for a modern, interactive feel.

- **Contact & Visit Us Pages:**  
  Includes a contact form, business hours, address, and an embedded Google Map for easy navigation.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**  
   `npm install`

2. **Run the development server:**  
   `npm run dev`

3. **Open in your browser:**  
   Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion, GSAP (for animations)
- i18next (for localization)
- Cursor (AI-powered coding, used at select steps)

## üßë‚Äçüíª About the Developer

This project demonstrates not only my React and frontend skills, but also my ability to **strategically use AI tools to accelerate and enhance web development**. By using Cursor and AI at key moments, I was able to implement complex features and animations efficiently, making the most of modern development workflows.
